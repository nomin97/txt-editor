# Text Editor 
  
  ## Description 
  This application is a text editor that runs in the brower. There are different aspects of this challenge required. User must configure the webpack, add the necessary CSS and babel loader, implementing asset caching to add offline accessibility, configuring the databases, and adding handlers to allow the app to be downloaded. Most of the code was provided in the starter code and adding the necessary changes was standard.
